  <p>We are planning a fix for the point positioning issues, but no ETA yet. Apologies for the inconvenience.</p>


  <h3>Basics</h3>

  <p>This is a point-count image annotation tool.</p>

  <p>The image shows the locations of the points.
      The points are colored depending on their status:
      unannotated, machine-annotated, human-annotated, or selected.</p>

  <p>The text field list on the right show the current labels for each point.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>If the label is in black text, the point is human-annotated. Once all points
      are human-annotated and saved, you'll see an "ALL DONE" indicator below the list, indicating
      that you are done annotating the image.</li>
      <li>If the label is in <span style='color:#888888'>gray text</span>,
      the point is machine-annotated. Machine labels are just there to give you
      guidance; you need to confirm these labels (thus making them human-annotated)
      before they are counted in your source's statistics.</li>
      </ul>


  <h3>Selecting a point to label</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>Click on one of the text fields on the right, or <kbd>Shift</kbd>-click on the image to select a point.</li>
      <li>Press the <kbd>.</kbd> key to go to the first point needing annotation.</li>
      <li>Move to the next or previous point with <kbd>Tab</kbd> and <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd>.</li>
  </ul>


  <h3>Labeling the chosen point</h3>
  <p>Once you have chosen a point, a text field will appear over the image.
      Type a label code in this text field and hit
      <span class='key_non_mac'><kbd>Enter</kbd></span><span class='key_mac'><kbd>Return</kbd></span>
      to confirm it.</p>
  <p>If you have machine annotations enabled in your Settings and your source,
      you may see a list of ranked machine suggestions along with probability scores
      (for example, "Favia [25%]") before you even start typing. From here, you can
      either pick a suggestion or just start typing your own label. Note that if you
      want to pick the first suggestion (the same as the light gray text), all you
      have to do is hit
      <span class='key_non_mac'><kbd>Enter</kbd></span><span class='key_mac'><kbd>Return</kbd></span>
      .</p>
  <p>Alternatively, below the image is a grid of label buttons; there's one button for each
      label in your Source's labelset. You can label the current point by
      clicking the corresponding button.</p>


  <h3>Saving your work</h3>
  <p>To save your work, click the "Save Progress" button on the lower right, or hit
      <span class='key_non_mac'><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd></span>
      <span class='key_mac'><kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd></span>.
      There are two cases where you won't be able to save:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>When no changes have been made. In this case, the button text
              will say "Saved".</li>
          <li>In certain circumstances, a point may somehow get labeled with
              an invalid label code. In this case, the button text will say "Error".</li>
      </ul>


  <h3>Selecting multiple points</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>Select multiple points by
          <span class='key_non_mac'><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-clicking</span>
          <span class='key_mac'><kbd>Cmd</kbd>-clicking</span>
          the points on the image.</li>
      <li>You may also click the numbers next to the text field list.</li>
      <li>For some quick select options, use these buttons on the upper right:
          <img alt="Select none icon" src="{% static "img/Icon_select-none.png" %}"/>,
          <img alt="Select unannotated icon" src="{% static "img/Icon_select-unannotated.png" %}"/>,
          and <img alt="Selection inversion icon" src="{% static "img/Icon_select-inversion.png" %}"/>.
          Hover your mouse over them to see what they do.</li>
      <li>To use the rectangle select <img alt="Rectangle select icon" src="{% static "img/Icon_rectangle-select.png" %}"/> tool,
          click the rectangle select icon, then click and drag on the image to
          draw a rectangle. The points contained in that rectangle will be added
          to your current selection.</li>
      <li>Once multiple points are selected, you can assign a label to them
          in the same ways as before: by typing in the text field, picking
          a suggestion, or clicking a label button.</li>
      <li>Note: Selecting multiple points will give you more accurate
          machine suggestions!</li>
  </ul>


  <h3>Getting a better look at a point</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>To zoom in, left-click on the image or press <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>&uarr;</kbd>.</li>
      <li>To zoom out,
          <span class='key_non_mac'>right-click</span><span class='key_mac'><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-click</span>
          on the image or press <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>&darr;</kbd>.</li>
      <li>You can also zoom with these buttons on the upper right:
          <img alt="Zoom in icon" src="{% static "img/Icon_zoom-in.png" %}"/>,
          <img alt="Zoom out icon" src="{% static "img/Icon_zoom-out.png" %}"/>,
          and <img alt="Zoom fit icon" src="{% static "img/Icon_zoom-fit.png" %}"/>.</li>
      <li>To toggle between different point display modes, use these buttons on the upper right:
          <img alt="Show all points icon" src="{% static "img/Icon_point-mode-all.png" %}"/>,
          <img alt="Show selected points icon" src="{% static "img/Icon_point-mode-selected.png" %}"/>,
          and <img alt="Show no points icon" src="{% static "img/Icon_point-mode-none.png" %}"/>.
          Hover your mouse over them to see what they do.</li>
      <li>If the text field on the image is getting in the way, you can move it to
          a different location by pressing <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>&rarr;</kbd>.
          Press these keys again to move it back.</li>
      <li>There are two ways to adjust the Brightness and Contrast values:
          use the sliders, or type a value in the text field.
          Click "Apply" to apply the new values.
          Click "Reset" to reset both to 0.</li>
      <li>There are various Settings (see below) that can make it easier
          for you to find points, and see what's under a point. You can
          customize point colors, point marker shapes, and the sizes of
          point markers and numbers.</li>
  </ul>


  <h3>Navigate to another image</h3>
  <p>The bottom-right part of the annotation tool has Prev and Next buttons.
     These buttons take you to the previous or next image in the image set.
     Images are ordered by filename.</p>
  <p>If you got here from the Browse Images page,
     the image set is determined by your last image search.
     Otherwise, the image set consists of all images in the source.</p>
  <p>The "Return to Browse" link takes you back to the Browse page for the
     current image set.</p>
  <p>Tip: If you want to go through unclassified or unconfirmed images
     only, use the Browse search form's "Annotation status" field
     to narrow down the image set.</p>


  <h3>Settings</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>To open the annotation tool settings,
          click the "Settings" button at the top.</li>
      <li>Remember to Save any settings that you want to keep.</li>
  </ul>
