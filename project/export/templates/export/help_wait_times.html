<p><strong>Note about all exports:</strong> the export file may take a long time to generate. After you click "Go", CoralNet will start generating the export file, and you must stay on this page until the export file is generated. Once it has finished generating, your browser will start downloading the file (or will prompt you to choose a download location).</p>
