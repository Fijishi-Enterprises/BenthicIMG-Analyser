This page explains rationale, if any, for picking certain terms over others in English descriptions across the site.


Sign in, Sign out, Register

See `this ux.stackexchange thread <http://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/1080/using-sign-in-vs-using-log-in>`__ and part of `this Coding Horror article <https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-god-login/#pickcommonwords>`__.

1. Using both "Sign in" and "Sign up", especially right next to each other, may add unnecessary cognitive load in figuring out which is which. Both start with "Sign" and are followed by a two-letter word. Using "Register" instead of "Sign up" makes the distinction clearer.

2. It seems "Sign in" and "Sign out" are slightly more common than "Log in" and "Log out". There is also the argument that "Sign in/out" has the nice parallel of entering or exiting an office building.
