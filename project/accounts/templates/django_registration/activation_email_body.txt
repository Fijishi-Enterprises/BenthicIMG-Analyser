Dear {{ user.username }},

Welcome to CoralNet!

Here are some resources to help get you started with the site:

1) Help portal: {{ request.scheme }}://{{ request.get_host }}{% url 'pages:help' %}

2) Google Group forum for questions, discussion, and site announcements: {{ forum_link }} We highly recommend subscribing to this Google Group. You can also search previous forum threads for common questions.

3) If you have any issues with your CoralNet user account, you can post in this forum thread instead of creating a new thread: {{ account_questions_link }}

4) Data policy and general information about CoralNet: {{ request.scheme }}://{{ request.get_host }}{% url 'about' %}


A few other things to keep in mind:

1) We are always looking to improve the site and the user experience. We do have limited resources and won't always have the opportunity to implement suggestions, but we appreciate your feedback.

2) Please make your data public if possible. The more public data on the site, the better for the community.

3) If you found this email in your Spam folder, you should add "noreply@coralnet.ucsd.edu" to your contact list to ensure you receive future emails from us without problems. We will use email for account-related concerns (such as password-reset requests) and for major site announcements.
