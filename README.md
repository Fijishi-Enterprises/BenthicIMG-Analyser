## Building and viewing the documentation

- Download or `git clone` this project.
- Install Python and Sphinx. You can do this by either following the installation steps (docs/installation.rst in this repo) until Sphinx is installed, or you can use some other Python environment which already has Sphinx installed.
- Open a terminal/command line, cd to the `docs` directory, and run `make html`. (This command is cross platform, since there's a ``Makefile`` as well as a ``make.bat``.)
- Open `docs/_build/html/index.html` in a web browser to start browsing the documentation.
- It's also possible to output in formats other than HTML, if you use ``make <format>`` with a different format. See [Sphinx's docs](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/quickstart.html#running-the-build).
