# An alternative is the 'future' package, but its methods
# seem to be less well recognized by Python IDEs, at least PyCharm

# Nevertheless, future's cheat sheet is useful:

six==1.10.0

Django>=1.11.23,<2

# Per-object permissions
# e.g. "can edit this source" not just "can edit sources"

# (A currently active, package friendly fork of it; also endorsed by Django)
Pillow==4.1.1

# For Markdown support in django-andablog
Markdown>=3.1.1,<4

# Simple blog.
# Requires: django, Pillow, six
django-andablog==3.0.0

# System for generating smaller versions of images.
# Requires: django, Pillow

# Amazon Web Services SDK for Python
# There's a newer package called boto3, but the interface is completely
# different, and django-storages doesn't support that yet
boto==2.40.0

# Nicer interface for AWS S3 compared to using boto alone; also supports
# many other storage systems.
# Even if a dev machine doesn't use S3, we still want this installed to make
# module imports work.
# Requires: boto

# Python 2's CSV module has poor support for Unicode and multiplatform
# newline chars. This backport of Python 3's CSV module is less painful to
# work with, even in a Python 2 system.
# Usage: `from backports import csv`
# This package should also work for Python 3, so no conditional imports should
# be needed. But after moving to Python-3-only, it would be best to simplify to
# `import csv`.
backports.csv==1.0.6

# HTML parsing.
# Also comes with a character encoding detection tool called "Unicode, Dammit":
# https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#unicode-dammit
beautifulsoup4==4.6.0

# BeautifulSoup's encoding detection becomes more accurate if chardet or
# cchardet is installed. chardet is older; cchardet is much faster.
cchardet==2.1.4

# Library for testing; can replace parts of the system under test with
# mock objects.
# Can be replaced with Python standard library's mock from Python 3.3 onward.
mock==2.0.0

# More elegant filepath calculations compared to os.path.
# pathlib has become part of the Python 3 standard library. pathlib2, an
# unofficial backport of pathlib to Python 2, is the best bet for migrating
# cleanly and idiomatically to Python 3.
# However, pathlib2 does have a major flaw: paths with non-ASCII characters
# are not supported. The only way to support that is to move to Python 3
# eventually. https://github.com/mcmtroffaes/pathlib2/issues/34
pathlib2==2.3.0
# unipath hasn't been updated since early 2015 (as of late 2017).
