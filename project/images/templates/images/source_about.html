    <h2>Sources</h2>

    <p>A Source is CoralNet's name for a coral analysis project.</p>

    <p>To get started, create a Source or get invited to a Source. You can choose to make your Source public or private.
       Once you have a Source, you'll create a labelset, which is the set of labels that you'll use to annotate your images.
       Image annotation means identifying points of the image: as Acropora coral, Porites coral, algae, and so on.</p>
    
    <p>Once you have a Source and labelset, you can upload images and start annotating them, using our in-browser annotation tool.
       You can also upload pre-existing annotations.
       Then, you can view annotation statistics on your entire Source or a subset of images. You can filter or aggregate images by image date and up to 5 custom metadata fields that you define.</p>
