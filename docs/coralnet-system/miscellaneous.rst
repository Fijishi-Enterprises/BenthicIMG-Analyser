Alpha production server hardware
--------------------------------
In case anyone at UCSD asks about the alpha production server again, here are the hardware details:

- Motherboard: ASUS M4A78LT-M (2011/07)
- System disk: 1 TB, WD Blue, WD10FZEX (2016/06)
- Data disks: 2x 4 TB, Seagate (2014/10)

  - We only use one 2 TB partition on each disk. There was some difficulty with creating partitions larger than 2.2 TB; it's probably doable but we just never took the trouble to figure it out.

- Memory: 4x 4 GB DDR3 1333Mhz, G.SKILL (2011/07)
- Processor: AMD Phenom II X4 945 6MB L3 Cache (2011/07)
- Case: Cooler Master Elite 335 RC-335-KKN1-GP, Black (2011/07)

The disk drive bays' purple locks haven't stood the test of time. Be careful with them as they'll break easily. Get the disk well aligned in the bay first, then insert the lock all the way in before turning it (the lock has little words and arrows showing what the lock/unlock directions are). The disks seem to stay reasonably secure even without the locks, but it's best to use the locks if possible.

To enter the BIOS at startup, press and hold Delete on the screen with the motherboard name. (`Source <http://www.manualslib.com/products/Asus-M4a78lt-M-778986.html>`__) You might have to wait at least a half second after the screen's appearance before starting to hold Delete.
