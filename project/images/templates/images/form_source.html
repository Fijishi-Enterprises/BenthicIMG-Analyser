    <legend class="small">Names for Auxiliary Metadata Fields</legend>
    <span class="helptext_long">
    We provide several standard metadata fields for your images such as Date, Camera, Photographer, etc. These 5 auxiliary metadata fields, on the other hand, can be named anything you like.<br /><br />

    We encourage using these auxiliary metadata fields to guide how your images are organized. For example, if your coral images are taken at 5 different sites, then you can name one of these metadata fields Site, and then specify a site for each image: North Point, East Shore, etc. You will then be able to do things such as browse through all unannotated images from North Point, or aggregate coral coverage statistics over the images from East Shore.<br /><br />

    You can use as few or as many of these 5 metadata fields as you like.

        <legend class="smaller">Level of alleviation</legend>

        <span class="helptext_long">
        The CoralNet alleviate feature offers a trade-off between fully automated and fully manual annotation. This is done by auto-accepting machine annotations when they are sufficiently confident. Please refer to our <a href="https://vimeo.com/channels/coralnet/133397508"> instruction video</a> for an overview and <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0130312">this study</a> for more details.<br/><br/>
        
        This auto-acceptance happens when you enter the annotation tool for an image. Effectively, the machine's most confident points are "alleviated" from your annotation workload (for that image). Alleviated annotation decisions are treated as 'Confirmed', and are included when you export your annotations. <br/><br/>
        
        Users control this functionality by specifying the level of alleviation. For example, with 40% alleviation, the machine learning algorithm ("robot") will do 40% of the point annotations and leave the remaining 60% for the human operator. This level of alleviation is NOT per image, but the average across all remaining images. Some (easy) images may be fully alleviated, while other (harder) may have very little alleviated points. 0% alleviation corresponds to no alleviation (i.e. fully manual annotation).<br/><br/>
        
        When the first robot version is trained for your source, you can see the trade-off between the level of alleviation and the annotation accuracy. We recommend that you set the alleviation level to 0% until you have seen this trade-off curve. You can then adjust the alleviation level. <br/><br/>
        
        <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0130312">This study</a> suggests that a 5% drop is annotation accuracy has marginal (if any) impact on derived cover estimates. We therefore suggest that you set the level of alleviation corresponding to a 5% drop in accuracy.<br/><br/>

        NOTE1: The level of alleviation should not be confused with the confidence scores that are displayed during manual annotation. Once you set your desired level of alleviation, this is translated to a confidence score by the back-end, and any robot prediction above that confidence will be automatically accepted. 
        <br/><br/>

        NOTE2: Machine annotations that have <strong>not</strong> been Confirmed can optionally also be included in your export (see the 'export' page) <br/><br/>
