# Front page carousel images.
# Count = number of images in the carousel each time you load the front page.
# Pool = list of image IDs to randomly choose from, e.g. [26, 79, 104].
# The pool size must be at least as large as count.
#
# Two reasons why we hardcode a pool here, instead of randomly picking
# public images from the whole site:
# 1. It's easier to guarantee in-advance thumbnail generation for a small
# pool of images. We don't want new visitors coming to the front page and waiting for those thumbnails to generate.
# 2. Ensuring a good variety and at least decent quality among carousel
# images.
#
# If you don't have any images to use in the carousel (e.g. you're just
# setting up a new dev environment, or you're in some test environment), set
# count to 0 and set pool to [].
